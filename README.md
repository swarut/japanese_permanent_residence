# A Template and Guide for Japanese Permanent Residence Application.

Preparing for Japanese Permanent Residence application is a time consuming process. This repository was created to share how I prepare my application. Some example documents were added to help give some clues how they look like. The guide here will focus on the application with [Highly-skilled engineering in number 6 and 7](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/resources/nyukan_nyukan50.html?hl=en) as this was the one I applied for.

**Disclaimer:** This document was last updated in April 2024, so please double-check the requirements on [the official website](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html) before applying.

## How to Use / How to Prepare
The required documents are categorized into folders, each contains a note about how to prepare or some things you need to pay attention to.
Zairyuu and passport folders are just place holders to get you to know they are needed, no need to copy or print them out.
When I prepared, I scanned all necessary documents and put them into their designated folder to help me organize them easier.
I added some templates for covers that you can reuse, or at least copy it in your own way.

I organized and ordered the documents as below.

## Sending the Application at The Immigration Office
I went to the [immigration office in Shinagawa](https://goo.gl/maps/zYxWKWo2ZMyfVxHL7) as it is the closest one for me. There are some immigration offices in other places as well, such as in Tachigawa. 

You can get to the immigration office from Shinagawa station by taking a bus [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rFU2HtvwNKmSpXCR8). However, you can also walk there as well, it is only 2KM from the station which should take you around 25 minutes.

It is better to go there as soon as possible as the whole process can be finished fast if you don't have to wait for other queues before you. In my case, I arrived there at 8:40AM and I still need to queue up for around 20 minutes before I can get into the building (due to the Covid protection policy). I started the process from 9AM and got it finished around 10:10AM.

When you get into the building, go straight to the second floor. You will see the pre-check counter right away on the left side. The staffs here will check your documents and verify that you got all required documents. If all look good, they will give you a number tag for your queue, take it and go to B counter as shown in the image below. During the pre-check, they will help you black out some important information like your pension number. In my case, they asked me to put the real employment certificate of my current job as I use the copies for all employment certificates. Luckily I bring the real one with me. So please be aware and bring some spare documents with you just in case.

After you get the number tag, wait in front of the B counter. Once they call you, you have to hand in the documents and they will do a full check. I missed one document that the staff at pre-check counter did not mention to me, that is the acknowledgement document (‰∫ÜËß£Êõ∏ in 3-2). You can print this, but please fill in the date and signature with your own writing in the day of application. The staff in the B counter may ask you some questions as well. If things are ok, you have to wait on the right side of the B counter for your passport and zairyu card to be returned.

At the end, you will get the receipt. Take a photo of it, and make sure not to lose it, very important. 

**April 2024 update**, I arrived at 8:00 AM and queued up. By 8:30 AM, I entered the immigration center. At counter B, I showed my passport, and the Zairyu staff checked my documents and completed all tasks in just 10 minutes.

## FAQs
1. Can I apply for the Highly-Skilled Engineering category if I hold an Engineer/Specialist visa in humanities/International services?
   - Yes, you can apply if you meet the eligibility criteria for the Highly-Skilled Engineering category, which requires accumulating 70 points or more continuously for three years, or one year with 80 points or more. [ref Note 2](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/resources/nyukan_nyukan50.html?hl=en)
2. Is there any way to quickly calculate the points?
