# A Template and guide for Japanese Permanent Residence Application.

Preparing for Japanese Permanent Residence application is a time consuming process. This repository was created to share how I prepare my application. Some examples the documents were added to help give some clues how they look like. The guide here will focus on the application with [Highly-skill-engineering condition A](https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/nyuukokukanri07_00131.html) as this was the one I applied.

## How to use / How to prepare
The required documents are categorized into folders, each contains a note about how to prepare or some things you need to pay attention to.
Zairyuu and passport folders are just place holders to get you to know they are needed, no need to copy or print them out.
When I prepared, I scanned all necessary documents and put them into their designated folder to help me organize it easier
I added some templates for covers that you can reuse, or at least copy it in your own way.
