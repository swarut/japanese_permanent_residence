# Employment Certificate (在職証明書)
**Please make sure that this document is issued within 3 months before the application date.**

You can obtain 在職証明書 (*zaishoku shoumeisho*) from the company you are currently working for. The HR department should be familiar with the information required for this document. It should include your employment date and position at the very least. Please provide the **original document** for the certificate of your current job (you will also use this as a supporting document in (13), but a copy will suffice).

This is how it looks like:
